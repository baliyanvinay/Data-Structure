# Data-Structure
Overview of data structures using Python Programming

## 1. Linked List
In Linked list data structure, data is stored in forms of nodes(created using a Node class). Node class mainly contains two attributes, data and a point to next node. Each node in the list will have address to the next node in the series. The data could be scattered anywhere in the memory as long as the adddresses are stored in a Node object. 

## 2. Stacks
A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and removal of existing items always takes place at the same end(top). Opposite end of top is known as base. Stack of books. LIFO principle.
